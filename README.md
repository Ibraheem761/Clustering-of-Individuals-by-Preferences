# Clustering-of-Individuals-by-Preferences
This is a fun Clustering project based on a small Dataset I gathered from my classmates. It was interesting to see which individuals have the same preferences and the reasons behind their similarity. <br>
I also found relationships between certain variable categories like favorite music genre and favorite language. <br>
The algorithms I used are Multiple Correspondence Analysis, Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering, and k-means Clustering. <br>
